          <h2> Introduction: </h2>
          <p>Through this lab, we are introduced to Raspberry Pi and various components. The PI Cobbler is used to extend Raspberry Pi pins to a breadboard for easier circuit building. Since the Raspberry Pi cannot read analog signals by itself, an Analog-to-Digital
            Converter (ADC) is used. This will serve as a medium between some of our sensors, such as sound and light, and the Raspberry Pi. Finally, a Python script will be used to gather our various sensor data.</p>

            <h2> The PI Cobbler </h2>
            <p>The Pi Cobbler allows you to extend the Raspberry PI pins to a breadboard, allowing for easier circuit building to connect to our various sensors and ADC. A simple connection can be found to the right: </p>

          <h3> The ADC </h3>
          <p>Throughout this lab, we will be using an MCP3008 which will serve as our ADC. After configuration, it will be able to take in analog signals from our sensors and output them as digital signals that our Raspberry Pi can read. Without the ADC,
            our Raspberry Pi cannot correctly read from our sensors!

            Note: For a quick guide on Unix commands, check out:

          <p>
            After making all the necessary connections, it's time to connect the software! Fortunately, there's an Adafruit library for the MCP3008 that we can utilize. In order to install the library, navigate to the directory you are creating the project in on
            your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>sudo apt-get update</li>
            <li>sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev</li>
            <li>git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008.git</li>
            <li>cd Adafruit_Python_MCP3008</li>
            <li>sudo python setup.py install</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This will clone the library from github to your local repository.</p>
          <p>In the Adafruit Library's folder, edit examples/simpletest.py to look from the code on the left to the code on the right:

          <h2>Calculating the Output Voltage of the Photocell Circuit</h2>
          <p>
            Using the dark and light resistance values that we obtained, we can calculate the range of outputs by solving the voltage values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The equation we use to calculate the upper and lower bound is:
          </p>
          <p>
            Output Voltage = (5 V) * (10k / (10k + Photocell Resistance))
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the dark resistance we obtain a lower bound of 0.86V and using the light resistance, we obtain an upper bound of 4.24V.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h2>Calculating the expected values from the ADC</h2>
            <p>
              Now we can calculate the expected values from our ADC.
            </p>
            <p>
              The equation to convert the output voltage of the voltage divider to output from the ADC is:
            </p>
            <p>
              ADC value = (output voltage / 5v) *1023
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1023 value comes from the fact that the MCP3008 is a 10 bit ADC and the max value that can come from 10 bits is 1023 or 0x3FF(hexadecimal value). Therefore we only need to take the ratio of output to max voltage and multiply it by the max ADC value
              to convert.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the equation from above we, calculate that the ADC output should range from 177 to 868
            </p>
            <p>
              The observed readings from out MCP3008 did not agree with our calculations however. To fix this, we simply switched the places of the 10k resistor and the photocell. This means the input to the ADC will be the output voltage across the photocell. The
              light resistance of the photocell is small, resulting in a small output voltage and a digital value closer to 0. The dark resistance of the photocell is large, resulting in a larger output voltage and a digital value closer to 1023.

        <p>Now, let’s check the output of the sound sensor.</p>
        <p>Read the Gate, Envelope, and Audio signals using the Oscilloscope and they should look something like this:</p>

          <li>Audio: 2.25v - 2.93v</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s one problem, the ADC is operating at 3.3v but the output of the sound detector is 5v. In for the ADC to read the sound sensor values correctly, we have to bring down the voltage using a voltage divider.</p>
        <p>Because we were at home, we made use of six 330 ohm resistors that were laying around. Since the ratio we want to bring down the voltage is two thirds, we connect three 330 ohm resistors in series. By placing the input one one end of the resistor
          and taking the output across two of the resistors, we can successfully bring down the voltage.</p>

          First, run the example script from the adc. In the Adafruit_Python_MCP3008/examples directory, run:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>python simpletest.py</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Keeping track of the pin where the audio pin is connected, watch the values of the audio output and develop a rough average of the sound level. Then, clap next to the sound sensor and observe the average peak sound output from the sound sensor.

          The code for the clapper circuit is shown below:

          By observing the readings of the audio signal, we picked 620 to be our threshold value as it is greater than the average sound level of the room, but lower than the peak value of our claps.

          We can now use all the sensors to get a snapshot of the time, temperature, humidity, light level, gate, envelop, and audio data.

          Using code like this:

          And running it for an hour, we can compile the data to make graphs over time. So cool!
