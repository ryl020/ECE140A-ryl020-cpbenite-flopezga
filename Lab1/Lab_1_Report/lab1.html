          <h2> Introduction: </h2>
          <p>Through this lab, we are introduced to Raspberry Pi and various components. The PI Cobbler is used to extend Raspberry Pi pins to a breadboard for easier circuit building. Since the Raspberry Pi cannot read analog signals by itself, an Analog-to-Digital
            Converter (ADC) is used. This will serve as a medium between some of our sensors, such as sound and light, and the Raspberry Pi. Finally, a Python script will be used to gather our various sensor data.</p>

            <h2> The PI Cobbler </h2>
            <p>The Pi Cobbler allows you to extend the Raspberry PI pins to a breadboard, allowing for easier circuit building to connect to our various sensors and ADC. A simple connection can be found below: </p>

          <h3> The ADC </h3>
          <p>Throughout this lab, we will be using an MCP3008 which will serve as our ADC. After configuration, it will be able to take in analog signals from our sensors and output them as digital signals that our Raspberry Pi can read. Without the ADC,
            our Raspberry Pi cannot correctly read from our sensors!

          <h3> Setting Up the Software for the ADC </h3>
          <p>
            Note: For a quick guide on Unix commands, check out:
            <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities">

          </p>
          <p>
            After making all the necessary connections, it's time to connect the software! Fortunately, there's an Adafruit library for the MCP3008 that we can utilize. In order to install the library, navigate to the directory you are creating the project in
            on your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:
          </p>

          <ol>
              <li>sudo apt-get update</li>
              <li>sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev</li>
              <li>git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008.git</li>
              <li>cd Adafruit_Python_MCP3008</li>
              <li>sudo python setup.py install</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This will clone the library from github to your local repository.</p>
          <p>In the Adafruit Library's folder, edit examples/simpletest.py to look from this to this:

            Pi</p>

          <p>For our example we connected Gate to gate pin, Envelope to adc pin, and Audio to adc pin.</p>
          <p>Now, let’s check the output of the sound sensor.</p>
          <p>Read the Gate, Envelope, and Audio signals using the Oscilloscope and they should look something like this:</p>

          <p>From the pictures we can see the values are as follows:</p>
          <p>Gate: 4.93 - 5.23V</p>
          <p>Envelope: 90mv - 180mv</p>
          <p>Audio: 2.25v - 2.93v</p>
          <p>There’s one problem, the ADC is operating at 3.3v but the output of the sound detector is 5v. In for the ADC to read the sound sensor values correctly, we have to bring down the voltage using a voltage divider.</p>
          <p>Because we were at home, we made use of six 330 ohm resistors that were laying around. Since the ratio we want to bring down the voltage is two thirds, we connect three 330 ohm resistors in series. By placing the input one one end of the resistor
            and taking the output across two of the resistors, we can successfully bring down the voltage.</p>
          <p>[CIRCUIT HERE]</p>
          <p>Once the voltage divider is built, read the audio output pin on the sound sensor and the input pin on the ADC on the oscilloscope. Have the audio output pin on ch 1 and the input pin on ch 2.</p>
          <p>Your oscilloscope should look something like this:</p>

          <p>
            We will now use the sound sensor to make an led turn on when we clap. To access the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins to control the LED, we can refer to <a href="https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/27968772-turning-on-an-led-with-your-raspberry-pis-gpio-pins"> here </a>            as reference. An explanation for a simple script to turn on and off the LED can be found there as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, run the example script from the adc. In the Adafruit_Python_MCP3008/examples directory, run:
          </p>
          <p>
            run:

          <p>
            python simpletest.py
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping track of the pin where the audio pin is connected, watch the values of the audio output and develop a rough average of the sound level. Then, clap next to the sound sensor and observe the average peak sound output from the sound sensor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code for the clapper circuit is shown below:
          </p>
          <p>
            By observing the readings of the audio signal, we picked 620 to be our threshold value as it is greater than the average sound level of them room, but lower than the peak value of our claps.
